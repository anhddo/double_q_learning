My name is Anh Do. My interest lies into Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning Theory.
My research interest lies in study reinforcement learning algorithms with provable good performance.
Reinforment Learning (RL) is a area of Machine learning which concerned with sequential decision making in
an unknown environment. In particular, I have focused on two main problem in solving the sample inefficient 
and design a good exploration strategy in reinforcement learning.
