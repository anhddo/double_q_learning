I can't finish this work without the help of my family, especially mom who has 
supported me and encourage me to continue my education. I especially thank to my friend
at John Von Neumann Institute, Quan and Hieu, who has support and provide valuable information
on writing a good thesis. Moreover, I want to thank friend at VinAI research who have studied and done research
with me. And of course, I want to thank my mentor, Yasin Abbasi-Yadkori, who has guided me and 
taught me on reinforcement learning. Without the help of friend and family, I won't be able to finish this thesis
