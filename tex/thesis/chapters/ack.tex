\chapter{Acknowledgement}
First and foremost, I want to thank my mom who has supported me 
and encourage me since the beginning. I would like to thank to my friends
at John Von Neumann Institute, Quan and Hieu, who have supported 
and provided valuable information on writing this thesis. 
Moreover, I want to thank friends at VinAI research who have studied 
and done research with me. I would like to express my deep and 
sincere gratitude to my mentor, Yasin Abbasi-Yadkori, who has guided me 
taught me on doing research. Without the help of friends and family, 
I won't be able to finish this thesis.
