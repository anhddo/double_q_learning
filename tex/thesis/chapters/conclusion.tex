In this thesis, we have proposed an optimistic algorithm in the
infinite horizon for average reward problem setting with linear 
approximation. Our proposed algorithm efficiently solving the exploration 
problem. Beside, we also emperically evaluate our OVI algorithm, and it clearly show the advantages of using the optimism in the value iteration.
